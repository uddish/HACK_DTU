Gather Android App (Hack DTU Hackathon).

Project description - Developed an android app named Gather: A patient-centered app containing 2 modules aims to help the poor and the needy people.

[Module1:] Aims to solve the problem of lack of blood among the people in need. Our app allows users to create their own medical ID which will contain all their personal details and medical history allowing them to donate blood. The patientâ€™s family can request blood directly from our app and a notification will be sent to all the users and they can accept that request and help them.

[Module2:] Aims to help Poor people suffering from severe diseases and can not afford to pay for their treatment by creating a crowdfunding platform where poor people can raise money and each person registered in our app only has to donate a very minimal amount ranging from Rs. 1-100. Our idea is to tie up this initiative with various NGOs so that will create awareness among poor people so that they can use this platform.
